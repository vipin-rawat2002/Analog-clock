# Analog-clock
The Analog Clock project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how to create a functional and visually appealing clock using web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as an excellent introduction to the concepts of DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and JavaScript timing functions.
